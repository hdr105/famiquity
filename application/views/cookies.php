					Most websites you visit use cookies to improve your user experience by allowing the
					website to ‘remember’ you, either for the duration of your visit (using a ‘session cookie’) or
					for repeat visits (using a ‘persistent cookie’).‎<br><br>

					Cookies may be set by the website you are visiting (‘first party cookies’) or they may be set
					by other websites who run content on the page you are viewing (‘third party cookies’).‎

				<h2>What do cookies do?‎</h2>
				<p>Cookies have lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages efficiently,‎
					storing your preferences, and improving your experience of a website. Cookies make the
					interaction between you and the website faster and easier. If a website doesn’t use
					cookies, it will think you are a new visitor every time you move to a new page on the site,‎
					for example, even after you “log in,” if you move to another page it won’t recognise you
					and it won’t be able to keep you logged in.‎

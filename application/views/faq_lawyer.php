                                        <p>Famiquity has spent years conducting user research of multiple divorced men and women,
payors and recipients, in order to identify common relationship breakdown factors. We apply
these factors to various life decisions in order to provide relationship and financial reports.</p>

                                        <p>Famiquity asks financial and relationship questions within our digital interfaces, and provide a
free financial risk report. If the user would like more details of this report, we can provide them
detailed Reports so they can seek advice from lawyers and other professionals. In order to
process these Reports, they must spend one credit, which may be gifted from a relation or an
advisor. Also, couples can share answers in the form of a memorandum, in order to have a
lawyer to create a marriage contract.</p>

event of their client’s separation. From a revenue generation perspective, Famiquity provides
lawyers client leads, coupled with Reports that provide relative details in order to save time
gathering this information from clients. Lawyers also may get introduced to other professionals,
advisors or influencers of clients. One lead can lead to 10 qualified leads.

questions honestly, Famiquity does not share Relationship reports. The client’s receive a report
about their relationship risks, and may share that if they choose.</p>

                                            payors and recipients, in order to identify common relationship breakdown factors. We apply
                                            these factors to various life decisions in order to provide relationship and financial reports.</p>

                                        <p>Advisors register and receive 30 day free trials for every client they introduce to Famiquity.
                                            Famiquity gathers financial and relationship data, as well as your client’s other influencers and
                                            professionals in their lives. Clients receive a free financial risk report. If clients wish to receive
                                            the details of the financial and relationship risks, they must spend one credit. Advisors may
                                            purchase credits in bulk to provide their clients, in order to schedule a meeting, receive the

                                            Advisors receive access to ongoing financial data of clients, some they do not currently have
                                            about their clients, their spouses/partners, and their network of family, friends, co-workers, and
                                            professionals that influence them. Advisors can deepen relationships and coordinate the efforts
                                            to reduce financial risk for their clients.
